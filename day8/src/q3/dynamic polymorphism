Q3) Explain dynamic polymorphism ?

Ans=> dynamic polymorphism is basically method overriding it is support by inheritance.
      when we write method in parent class we also create same signature method in child class and it's bassically 
      overriding and overridden method have higher priority betwwen two.
      like when we create chid class object of parent type than overridden method in child got executed by this object.
