Q3) Explain abstract class and interface with an example.

Ans=> abstract class is a partially implemented class in which we can  use abstract method(method without body) abstract class must be extended by another 
      class.
      without extending abstract class is meaning less.
      we can create abstract class by abstract keyword.
      in this abstract class we can also use implemented method.
      eg:- 
          abstract class A{
              int x;
               abstract method1();
               abstract method2();
               method3(){
                  System.out.println("i am in method3 of A");
               }
          } 
          
      interface is a class like structure in java which can be created by interface keyword. it is a fully unimplemented structure, which act like a 
      abstract class with all abstract method.
      but in interface all method is by default public abstract we don,t have to define that.
      in child class we have to use implements keyword rather than extends
      eg:- 
          interface B {
             method1(); //by default public abstract
             method2();
          }
          
          class C implements B{
             B obj = new C();
          }
